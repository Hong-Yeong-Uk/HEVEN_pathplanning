1. Make a directory called "data" using the OS library in python
2. Create inside the folder 'data' 100 txt files with the name "00X.txt" (while X is the number of that file) eg:
	000.txt 001.txt 0096.txt
3. Inside every txt file should contain written X (file number). eg:
	inside 0019.txt -> 19
4. Create a txt file called 'files.txt' with the paths to all the new txt files outside the data folder. eg:
	data/000.txt
	data/001.txt
	...
	data/0098.txt
	data/0099.txt

Use the given files as example!
