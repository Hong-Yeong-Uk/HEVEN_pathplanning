The main problem of this HW is to detect both lines in a lane and its center line.

1. Open the given videos.
2. There are several ways to solve this. You can google and study about lane detection. 
	HSV colors, HoughlinesP, CannyEdge and GaussianBlur are some of the functions you might need.
	Usage of OpenCV is more than recommended.

3. Draw the left side line as RED and the right side BLUE. Also, find the middle point (desired path) and draw a line in GREEN
4. Use addWeighted to add all masks on the original image.
5. The program should work for finding the lanes in at least YW.mp4 and YW.mp4
